# Cow and Bell

![Example](https://puu.sh/BuOKp/85c026aa54.png)

The numerical version of the game is usually played with 4 digits, but can also be played with 3 or any other number of digits.
On a sheet of paper, the players each write a 4-digit secret number. The digits must be all different. Then, in turn, the players try to guess their opponent's number who gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bell", if in different positions, they are "cows".

*Example:*

Secret number: _4271_

Opponent's try: _1234_

Answer: _1 bell and 2 cows._ (The bell is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".)
