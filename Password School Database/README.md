Loggin page here will provide a user with an error for an incorrect password, and open up the next window if they are both correct.

Left we view student, which will prompt you to ask for a Student ID and provide the information on them.

Right we have add student to the database, this was left unfinished. This would prompt the user asking for each area of information required for a student. Sadly it required a large amount of data checking.

Overall I never got it to save into the JSON file I had made as I was unable to find out how I could format it into JSON and paste it back into the file.
